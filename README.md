# Customer Segmentation & Recommendation System 🛍️💻📊

## Overview:

This project aims to perform customer segmentation and build a recommendation system to improve customer experience and sales.

## Steps to Run the Project:

1. **Data Collection:**
    * Collect customer data from a database or a CSV file. 📦
2. **Data Preprocessing:**
    * Clean the data by removing missing values and irrelevant information. 🧹
    * Transform the data into a suitable format for analysis. 🔄
3. **Customer Segmentation:**
    * Use clustering algorithms like K-Means or hierarchical clustering to segment customers. 🎯
    * Evaluate the segmentation results and select the optimal number of clusters. 📊
4. **Recommendation System:**
    * Use collaborative filtering or content-based filtering to build the recommendation system. 🔍
    * Evaluate the recommendation system using metrics like precision, recall, and F1 score. 📈
5. **Visualization:**
    * Visualize the customer segments and recommendation results using tools like Matplotlib or Seaborn. 📊
6. **Results Interpretation:**
    * Interpret the customer segments and recommendation results to gain insights into customer behavior and preferences. 🧠

## Dependencies:
